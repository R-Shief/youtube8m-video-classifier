## R-Shief Video Classifier Microservice
This is the inference model for the R-Shief video classifier pipeline. It's a fork of [Antoine77340](https://github.com/antoine77340)'s open source [WILLOW](https://github.com/antoine77340/Youtube-8M-WILLOW), which is a highly effective inference model for frame level video features extracted via Google's Youtube8m MediaPipe feature extractor, for which we also have a Dockerized micro-service [fork](https://github.com/R-Shief/youtube8m-feature-extractor). This fork modifies the model inference code to work as a Dockerized micro-service.
